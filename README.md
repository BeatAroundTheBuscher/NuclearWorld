# _NuclearWorld: A Post Nuclear Strategy Game_ #
Post-apocalyptic mod, inspired by Fallout. The War changed the world forever... the reasons behind, are no longer important. You just opened your Shelter, facing the Brave New World shaped by radiation, warfare, factions and mutants.

It is up to you to decide *what to do* in the Wasteland!
- Trade with the local settlements
- Eliminate insane mutants, keeping the villages safe
- Craft your own weapons and armors
- Befriend (or declare war on) mutants!
- Create wealth by producing goods and selling them
- Join a faction and wage a three-way-war for the control of the last remaining resources
- Lead expeditions to forgotten military bases and labs, looking for high-quality loot
- Become a pillager and attack caravans for profit
- And much more...
